# Eorzea's Folly: FFXIV Quest Maker

Inspired by (and using some of the assets from) [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/n4mcd7/i_created_a_custom_quest_template_thought_you_all/)

## Online App

[Access the live app!](https://www.tstackhouse.com/ffxiv-quest-maker/)

## To Do

- [x] Looks pretty awful on mobile, the layout needs love
- [ ] Don't use absolute positioning to build up the box
- [x] Scaling the box to the available viewport if it's too big
- [ ] Come up with an acutal palatte of css colors
- [x] Fonts aren't quite right
- [ ] Use the icon font for the section headers
- [ ] Image banner with a couple options
- [ ] Arbitrary height for shrinking/growing the box
- [ ] Quest Level Bubble
- [ ] Other Quest Type Icons - Need the images
- [ ] Start/Complete types (part of the above?)
- [ ] Repeatable icon
- [ ] Make Accept/Reject disableable
- [ ] Make Button text editable
- [ ] Quest Locked overlay
- [ ] Rewards tray
- [ ] Make the image banner optional
- [ ] Built in image export? - Seems possible with HTML2Canvas or WebRTC
